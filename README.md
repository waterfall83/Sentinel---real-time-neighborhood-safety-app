# **Sentinel**
### _A real-time danger detector and community alert system_

**Sentinel** is a crowdsourced danger-detection app that helps users stay safe by showing nearby hazards on a live map.  
Users can **report**, **upvote**, or **downvote** danger spots — making the map smarter and more reliable over time.

## **Core Features**
- **Live Map View** – See danger zones around you in real time.  
- **Instant Reporting** – Tap to mark nearby dangers (accidents, crime, roadblocks, etc.).  
- **Community Voting** – Upvote valid alerts or downvote false ones.

## **How It Works**
1. Users submit danger reports (type, description, location).  
2. The system aggregates and filters reports by proximity and reliability.  
3. Other users confirm or dismiss reports through upvotes/downvotes.  
4. The map dynamically updates to reflect trusted, active alerts.
